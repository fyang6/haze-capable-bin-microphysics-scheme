# haze-capable-bin-microphysics-scheme

Here are the codes and basic setup for Pi-chamber simulation using SAM with CCN-based and haze capable bin microphysics scheme. 

The SAM model is available from Dr. Marat Khairoutdinov of Stony Brook University (http://rossby.msrc.sunysb.edu/~marat/SAM.html). If using SAM for research, please make sure let Marat Khairoutdinov (Marat.Khairoutdinov@stonybrook.edu) add you as an user of SAM. The microphysics scheme is based on Chen and Lamb (1994) and is implemented in SAM by Fan Yang (BNL).

Paper based on this code is submitted to JAMES. The python codes to generate figures in the paper are also archived here.

For general questions, please contact Fan Yang (fanyang@bnl.gov).
