# haze-capable-bin-microphysics-scheme

This code is to share the basic setup for Pi-chamber simulation using SAM with CCN-based and haze capable bin microphysics scheme.

The SAM model is available from Dr. Marat Khairoutdinov of Stony Brook University (http://rossby.msrc.sunysb.edu/~marat/SAM.html). If using SAM for research, please make sure let Marat Khairoutdinov (Marat.Khairoutdinov@stonybrook.edu) add you as an user of SAM.

Paper based on this code is submitted to JAMES. The python codes to generate figures in the paper are also archived here.
